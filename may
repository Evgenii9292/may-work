There is no direct programming code available to calculate the square of a planet. However, you can calculate the square of a number using various programming languages. Here are examples in C and Python:

1. **C Program to Calculate Square of a Number** [source](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/c-program-to-calculate-square-of-a-number/)

```C
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number, Square;
    printf(" \n Please enter an integer number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    Square = Calculate_Square(number);
    printf("\n Square of %d is %d", number, Square);
    return 0;
}

int Calculate_Square(int Number) {
    return Number * Number;
}
```

2. **Python Program to Calculate Square of a Given Number** [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-profram-to-calculate-square-of-a-given-number/)

```Python
def Calculate_Square(Number):
    return Number * Number

if __name__ == '__main__':
    number = int(input("Please enter an integer number: "))
    print("Square of", number, "is", Calculate_Square(number))
```

These code examples demonstrate how to calculate the square of a number. However, to calculate the square of a planet, you would need to use astronomical calculations, which are beyond the scope of these programming examples. 

For a tutorial on computing planetary positions, you can refer to the following resource: [Computing planetary positions - a tutorial with worked examples](https://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html). 

In case you need help with a specific programming language, you can also ask a question on Quora, like this one: [How to square in C programming](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-square-in-C-programming).
